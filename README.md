# Complex Word Identification (CWI) Shared Task 2018 - JiaxinZhang

The task consists of predicting which words could be **difficult** and which could be *easy* for a non-native speaker, e.g.:

> "Both China and the Philippines **flexed** their *muscles* on Monday."

For details of the task, see [CWI Shared Task 2018](https://sites.google.com/view/cwisharedtask2018/)

This class project, we will be tackling the **binary classification task** for the **monolingual English** and **monolingual Spanish**tracks.

## GuideLines

Use python English.py or python Spanish.py in console to see the result.

**The code will run almost 5 minutes to 10 minutes. Because the model I used is Neural Network, and Word Embeddings will also take much time.**
